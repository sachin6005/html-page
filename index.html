                    <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural 
                        semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p 
                        surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

                        <h3>Elements</h3>
                        </header>
                        <p>
                                HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets thus: p[71][better source needed]
                                In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag" p and "end tag" p. The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.
                                Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.
                                The start tag may also include attributes within the tag. These indicate other information, such as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the presentation of the document, 
                                and for some tags such as the img used to embed images, the reference to the image resource in the format like this: 
                        </p>
                    </article>
                    <article class="article-1">
                        <Header>
                            <h3>Attributes</h3>
                        </Header>
                        <p>
                            Most of the attributes of an element are name-value pairs, separated by = and written within the start tag of an element after the element's name. The value may be enclosed in single or double quotes, although values consisting of 
                            certain characters can be left unquoted in HTML (but not XHTML).[73][74] Leaving attribute values unquoted is considered unsafe.[75] In contrast with name-value pair attributes, there are some attributes that affect the element 
                            simply by their presence in the start tag of the element,[6] like the ismap attribute for the img element.[76]

                            Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of the encoded information over its presentation (look). HTML has included semantic markup from its inception,[82] but has also included presentational markup, 
                            such as font, i and center tags. There are also the semantically neutral span and div tags. Since the late 1990s, when Cascading Style Sheets were beginning to work in most browsers, web authors have been encouraged to avoid t
                            he use of presentational HTML markup with a view to the separation of presentation and content.
                            An important type of web agent that does crawl and read web pages automatically, without prior knowledge of what it might find, is the web crawler or search-engine spider.
